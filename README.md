# Bangla-Unicode-to-ANSI

A simple script for godot to convert Bangla unicode font to Bangla ANSI font.

Current stable Godot 3.3 don't support Bangla font but with this script Bangla font can be render. Godot 4 going to support Bangla. Until Godot 4.0 release this script might come in handy.

Written in Gdscript. I'm still new to Godot. If thres is any error please open a issues I will do my best fix it.
